## Springs

There's a lot of variables that would change the feel of a switch. Spring swaps would affect:

* switch return or how snappy the switch is

* resting weight (when the switch is just chilling on your keyboard)

* actuation weight

* bottom out weight

* how drastic the difference when bottoming out between all of those weights are (typing feel)

There are other variables like amount of coils and the distance between the coils, but we are strictly talking about length here.

### Note: I use spring weight and spring force interchangeably.

If you have same bottom out weight, but longer spring, the longer spring makes the starting/resting weight and actuation weight higher, meaning it'll feel less stiff and more consistent.

If same bottom out weight, but shorter spring, the shorter spring makes the resting weight and actuation weight lower, and it'll make you feel like it takes a lot more force to bottom out, since you start out at a lower weight.

Switch housings compress springs to about 10mm, so pre-load means how much the spring is compressed in your switches. Because of the different compressions, you will have different force curves, which is usually shown as a graph where you see how much force is needed as you bottom out and let go.

## Typing Feel:

*The shorter spring will feel heavy faster as you press the switch, and will need more **FURTHER** force to bottom out.

*The longer spring will actually be heavier from the get-go, but you need less **FURTHER** force to bottom out.

*The longer spring will also feel more consistent/smoother throughout the keystroke, since the force doesn't increase as much the further you press the key.

Example: (NUMBERS ARE MADE UP, BUT ARE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFERENCES DUE TO SPRING LENGTH) 16mm 67g TX Long Spring could have a starting point at 55g, bottom out at 67g

20mm Flashquark Long Spring could have a starting point at 60g, bottom out at 67g

20mm+ Kinetic Labs Long Spring could have a starting point at 62g, bottom out at 67g

These slight mm differences can go a long way. As you press to bottom out, depending on the length of your spring, the force increases LESS when the spring is LONGER.
