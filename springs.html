<h1 id="springs">Springs</h1>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of variables that would change the feel of a switch. Spring swaps would affect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>switch return or how snappy the switch is</p>
</li>
<li><p>resting weight (when the switch is just chilling on your keyboard)</p>
</li>
<li><p>actuation weight</p>
</li>
<li><p>bottom out weight</p>
</li>
<li><p>how drastic the difference when bottoming out between all of those weights are (typing feel)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other variables like amount of coils and the distance between the coils, but we are strictly talking about length here.</p>
<h3 id="note-i-use-spring-weight-and-spring-force-interchangeably-">Note: I use spring weight and spring force interchangeably.</h3>
<p>If you have same bottom out weight, but longer spring, the longer spring makes the starting/resting weight and actuation weight higher, meaning it&#39;ll feel less stiff and more consistent.</p>
<p>If same bottom out weight, but shorter spring, the shorter spring makes the resting weight and actuation weight lower, and it&#39;ll make you feel like it takes a lot more force to bottom out, since you start out at a lower weight.</p>
<p>Switch housings compress springs to about 10mm, so pre-load means how much the spring is compressed in your switches. Because of the different compressions, you will have different force curves, which is usually shown as a graph where you see how much force is needed as you bottom out and let go.</p>
<h2 id="typing-feel-">Typing Feel:</h2>
<p><em>The shorter spring will feel heavy faster as you press the switch, and will need more <em>*FURTHER</em></em> force to bottom out.</p>
<p><em>The longer spring will actually be heavier from the get-go, but you need less <em>*FURTHER</em></em> force to bottom out.</p>
<p>*The longer spring will also feel more consistent/smoother throughout the keystroke, since the force doesn&#39;t increase as much the further you press the key.</p>
<p>Example: (NUMBERS ARE MADE UP, BUT ARE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFERENCES DUE TO SPRING LENGTH) 16mm 67g TX Long Spring could have a starting point at 55g, bottom out at 67g</p>
<p>20mm Flashquark Long Spring could have a starting point at 60g, bottom out at 67g</p>
<p>20mm+ Kinetic Labs Long Spring could have a starting point at 62g, bottom out at 67g</p>
<p>These slight mm differences can go a long way. As you press to bottom out, depending on the length of your spring, the force increases LESS when the spring is LONGER.</p>
